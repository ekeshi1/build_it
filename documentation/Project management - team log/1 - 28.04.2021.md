First meeting at 28 April 18:45(Lasted for 30 mins).
Decisions in the first meeting : 

Created Trello board:  https://trello.com/b/0DMj4UEx/build-it <br\>
Accepted hw in Github:  https://github.com/cs-ut-ee/project-group-8

Decided on Branching strategy and overall GitHub usage.No direct commits to the main branch should be made. For every requirement, a separate branch will be created. A requirement will be merged to main only after it is tested and the tests are passing.

Tasks:
1. Orkhan -> Create the class diagram.
2.Vera -> Get the Trello board started.
3. Anisa -> Initialize the project structure.
4. Erald -> Setup CI/CD
